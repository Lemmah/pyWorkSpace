# The Phonebook Example

This is just a simple phonebook code example to practice TDD with.
Some constraints:
- A phonebook has a list of contact names with their phone numbers.
- A phonebook is constent only if there are not two contacts with the same number and there are no contacts that are prefixes of others
- The phonebook is an object. ie. A class (OOP)
- Methods to the phonebook are such that I can add contacts, look them up and check if phonebook is consistent.
