# Variable names
'''
Rules:
    Cannot contain spaces.
    Are case sensitive.
    Cannot start with a number.
Guidelines:
    Should be descriptive like `user_age`. (not x, b or a)
    Use a casing scheme. ie: camelCase, PascalCase, under_score
    Abbreviations can be `smells.` Do not write variables that you need to defend.
